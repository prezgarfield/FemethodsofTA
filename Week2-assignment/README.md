# Week2
This is the repository for the Week 2 assignment in DHUM 72500. 

To complete the assignment, look just above this "read me" section to the right side of your screen and click the clone or download button. A small pop-up window will open. Select "Download ZIP." This will download a folder with the notebook file. Save the .zip file to a location on your desktop, preferably a folder that you create just for activities for this course. Unzip the contents of the file by finding it on your computer and double clicking. If you have not already done so, open Anaconda Navigator. Click the "Launch" button under "jupyter notebook." From the open and running notebook, open the Week2-notebook.ipynb file. The directions for what to do in the notebook are included in the notebook itself.
